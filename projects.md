### [Dobot Image Classifier](https://github.com/andrewfulton9/capstone_project)

An image classification system built in collaboration with Dobot, Inc. that uses a convolutional neural net to predict what users are saving for based on images they upload to the Dobot app

### [Spontaneous Alternation Scorer GUI](https://github.com/andrewfulton9/SA_scorer_gui)

A GUI to score and analyze Spontaneous Alternation data. Built with python, uses Pandas, xlrd, and guidata.

### [Spontaneous Alternation Scorer Webapp](https://github.com/andrewfulton9/SA_scorer_webapp)
##### IN PROGRESS

A webapp version of the SA scorer GUI built on top of flask.

### [Lab Notebook Examples](https://github.com/andrewfulton9/lab_notebook_examples)

A couple of analyses I performed in Jupyter Notebooks for the lab I worked at. One is an analysis of ELISA protein assay pilot data. Another is an analysis of the indifference points of rats performing an operant chamber task for a pilot study.
