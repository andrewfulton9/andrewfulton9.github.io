This is a visualization showing Colorado's changing population starting in 1990 and projecting out to 2040. I used Python and Plotly to build this. My code can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewfulton9/Colorado_Population_Analysis). The data I used to plot this was provided by Colorado's state government and can be found [here](https://data.colorado.gov/Demographics/Colorado-Population-Projections/q5vp-adf3)
